SEI Project 1 : “Echo”

Echo is a spin-off of the popular game “Simon”, where the player essentially echoes the sequence of notes played by the game. The game signifies which “button” to press by flashing a light and playing a sound corresponding to that button. The game then adds that key to a sequence, that the player must echo. The player then has a certain amount of time to “echo” that sequence. As the player correctly inputs the sequence, the sequence grows longer and longer, and it becomes a battle of memory.
